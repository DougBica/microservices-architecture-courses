Loose coupling

- Communicate via network
- Upstream doesn't have any reference inside de code about downstream services
- Minimal calls 
- Own database each services 
- Keep contracts and interfaces stables 
- Use message broker for asynchronous communication  
- Expose minimum data 
- Backward compatibility 
- Stateless 
- Versioning of services and APIs
