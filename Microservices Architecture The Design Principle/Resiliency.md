- Design for failure, if some internal connection has a problem, the design need to handle this  
- Third party API, shield with a service with a dedicated service for this 

## Circuit Breaker 

- Count a failures and after a set number of retries it stops to try to connect for a time 
## Retry Pattern

 - Retry when failure 
## Timeout Pattern

- limit time to wait for a response 

## Caching Strategy

## Async Communication

- Message broker
