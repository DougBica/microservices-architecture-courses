Disadvantages 

- Single application that keeps the front-end (Presentation layer) , business (Business Layer) and data access logic (Data Layer) together 
- When it grows in a wrong way, it could transform into a spaghetti code, high couple and hard to maintain and develop new features.
- Its a risk to make experiments, if that experiment is not good in terms of performance, it can compromise the entire application.
- The technology is fixed in the entire services, you cant use a new technology, for example.

Ventages
- Easy to replicated the environment 
- Quick solution and prototyping
